A simplified library version based on atftp project. Check tftp_api.h and tftpd_api.h for details.

This project was modified to be used in project [ARIEL](https://github.com/TCC-PES-2022)

To clone this repository, run:

    git clone https://github.com/TCC-PES-2022/atftp.git
    cd atftp
    git checkout libatftp -f
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Before building your project, you may need to install some dependencies. 
To do so, on Ubuntu, run:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential=12.9ubuntu3 
    
For tests, you'll also need
    
    sudo apt install -y ruby-full=1:3.0~exp1 lcov=1.15-1

Export the instalation path to the environment:
    export DESTDIR=<path_to_install>

You can also define this variable in your `.bashrc` file. or when calling any make rule. The default installation path is `/tmp`.

To build, run:
    make deps && make

To install, run:
    make install

To test and generate coverage report, run:
    cd test && make report

    -----------------

atftp stands for Advanced Trivial File Transfer Protocol. It is called
"advanced", by contrast to others TFTP servers, for two reasons.
Firstly, it is intended to be fully compliant with all related
RFCs. This include RFC1350, RFC2090, RFC2347, RFC2348 and RFC2349. To
my knowledge, there is no TFTP server currently available in the
public domain that fulfills this requirement. Secondly, atftp is
intended for serving boot files to large clusters. It is
multi-threaded and support multicast (RFC2090 and PXE), allowing
faster boot of hundreds of machine simultaneously.

I started writing the atftp server after trying to boot Debian from
the LAN using pxelinux (distributed with syslinux). Since pxelinux
needs support for the "tsize" option defined in RFC2349, I looked for
different TFTP servers but found none that fulfilled my needs.

With atftp, I have successfully used pxelinux and dhcpd to boot from
the LAN. Unfortunately, new development will slow down since I do it
on my spare time and atftp now does what I need.  However, atftp is
actively maintained. Comments, bug reports and patches are welcome.

Great thanks to my brother Remi who works on the client and server
implementation and the debian packaging.
